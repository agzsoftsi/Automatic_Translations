1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02
when you're building applications you

2
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
want them to deliver a great experience

3
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
for your users maybe you want your

4
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
application to generate in-app purchase

5
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
options during a gaming session rapidly

6
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
validate street address updates or make

7
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
image thumbnails available instantly

8
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
after a user uploads photos to make this

9
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
magic happen your application needs

10
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
back-end code that runs in response to

11
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
events like image uploads in app

12
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
activity website clicks or sensor

13
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
outputs but managing the infrastructure

14
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
to host and execute back-end code

15
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
requires you to size provision and scale

16
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
a bunch of servers manage operating

17
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
system updates apply security patches

18
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
and then monitor all this infrastructure

19
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
for performance and availability

20
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
wouldn't it be nice if you could just

21
00:00:47 --> 00:00:48
focus on building great applications

22
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
without having to spend lots of time

23
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
managing servers introducing AWS lambda

24
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
AWS lambda is a compute service that

25
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
runs your back-end code in response to

26
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
events such as object uploads to Amazon

27
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
s3 buckets updates to Amazon DynamoDB

28
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
tables data and Amazon Kinesis dreams or

29
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
in-app activity once you upload your

30
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
code to lambda the service handles all

31
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
the capacity scaling patching and

32
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
administration of the infrastructure to

33
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
run your code and provides visibility

34
00:01:22 --> 00:01:24
into performance by publishing real-time

35
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
metrics and logs to Amazon Cloud Watch

36
00:01:26 --> 00:01:31
all you need to do is write the code AWS

37
00:01:31 --> 00:01:33
lambda is very low cost and does not

38
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
require any upfront investment when you

39
00:01:35 --> 00:01:38
use AWS lambda you're simply charged a

40
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
low fee per request and for the time

41
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
your code runs measured in increments of

42
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
100 milliseconds getting started with

43
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
AWS lambda is easy there are no new

44
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
languages tools or frameworks to learn

45
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
you can use any third-party library even

46
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
native ones the code you run on AWS

47
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
lambda is called a lambda function you

48
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
just upload your code as a zip file or

49
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
design it in the integrated development

50
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
environment in the AWS management

51
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
console or you can select from a list of

52
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
function samples pre-built for common

53
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
use cases

54
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
image conversion file compression and

55
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
change notifications and built-in

56
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
support for the AWS SDK makes it easy to

57
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
call other AWS services once your

58
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
function is loaded you select the event

59
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
source to monitor such as an Amazon s3

60
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
bucket or Amazon DynamoDB table and

61
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
within a few seconds lambda will be

62
00:02:34 --> 00:02:35
ready to trigger your function

63
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
automatically when an event occurs with

64
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
lambda any event can trigger your

65
00:02:41 --> 00:02:42
function making it easy to build

66
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
applications that respond quickly to new

67
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
information to learn more about AWS

68
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
lambda visit our website and you can get

69
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
your first lambda function up and

70
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
running with a few clicks in the AWS

71
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
management console and with the AWS free

72
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
tier you can try lambda for free
