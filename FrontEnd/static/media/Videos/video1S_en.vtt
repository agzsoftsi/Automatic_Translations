00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Hello. We are DKNG studios,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.680
that stands for DK, Dan Kuhlken.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.590
I'm NG, Nathan Goldman and we are a design and illustration studio based in California.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.445
Our measure started working in the world of gig posters,

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.760
but beyond that we've expanded to all types of work for

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.690
the music industry and beyond including corporate branding,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.240
packaging design, and really any type of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.955
project that combines both illustration and design work.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:30.240
Today we're going to be talking about isometric illustration.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.635
A lot of people may recognize that as SimCity style or

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:40.740
recorder overhead view and ability to create a three-dimensional geometric illustration.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.980
Isometric illustration is a way of equally representing three sides of an object,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.215
having light source and shadow.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:52.190
We find it to be more of a step-by-step into follow approach to

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.270
creating something that realistically has three-dimensionality to it.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.935
Throughout this class, we're going to show you

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:01.820
step-by-step processes of how we use specific tools in illustrator,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.780
and all pretty basic tools to create isometric design.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.650
By the end of it, you're going to have what looks like a fairly complex drawing,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.495
but it was all made pretty easily through basic illustrator tools.

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:17.060
Three D illustration doesn't need to be intimidating and one thing we

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.570
hope you take away from this class is with this isometric approach.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.905
It's easy to follow a step-by-step method to get full 3D results,

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:29.240
but without knowledge of modeling programs or anything more complicated than that.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.800
As you're taking this class,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.495
please post to the project gallery,

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:35.240
we would love to see your process and your final products.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.910
We're excited to have you in the class and let's get started.
